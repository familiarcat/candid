// 2. Open browser console
// 3. Test skill-focused data generation
```
- [ ] Test with existing skill ID
- [ ] **Expected**: Skill as root node
- [ ] **Expected**: Job seekers with that skill (Level 1)
- [ ] **Expected**: Positions requiring that skill (Level 1)
- [ ] **Expected**: Companies posting those positions (Level 2)
- [ ] **Expected**: No nodes beyond Level 2

#### **Test 2.2: Position-Focused Data Generation**
- [ ] Test with existing position ID
- [ ] **Expected**: Position as root node
- [ ] **Expected**: Company that posted position (Level 1)
- [ ] **Expected**: Required skills (Level 1)
- [ ] **Expected**: Hiring authorities at company (Level 2)
- [ ] **Expected**: Matched job seekers (Level 1)

#### **Test 2.3: Match-Focused Data Generation**
- [ ] Test with existing match ID
- [ ] **Expected**: Job seeker and hiring authority as dual root nodes
- [ ] **Expected**: Company employing authority (Level 1)
- [ ] **Expected**: Shared skills between job seeker and authority (Level 1)
- [ ] **Expected**: No additional connections beyond Level 2

### **3. Hook Integration Testing**

#### **Test 3.1: useComponentVisualization Hook**
- [ ] Test hook with different component types
- [ ] **Verify**: Returns correct available entities
- [ ] **Verify**: Generates focused data when entity selected
- [ ] **Verify**: Controls work properly (open/close modal, switch entities)

#### **Test 3.2: Page-Level Integration**
- [ ] Test pageHelpers.renderVisualizationButton()
- [ ] Test pageHelpers.renderEntitySelector()
- [ ] Test pageHelpers.getModalProps()
- [ ] **Verify**: All helpers return valid React components/props

### **4. Root Node Processor Testing**

#### **Test 4.1: 2-Level Edge Limiting**
- [ ] Generate network with many connected entities
- [ ] **Verify**: Only nodes within 2 levels are included
- [ ] **Verify**: Root node is properly emphasized (larger, different color)
- [ ] **Verify**: Distance-based opacity/sizing works correctly

#### **Test 4.2: Layout and Visual Enhancement**
- [ ] Test radial layout positioning
- [ ] **Verify**: Root node is centered
- [ ] **Verify**: Level 1 nodes form inner circle
- [ ] **Verify**: Level 2 nodes form outer circle
- [ ] **Verify**: No overlapping or crowded layouts

## üîß MANUAL TESTING PROCEDURES

### **Procedure A: End-to-End Company Visualization**
1. Open http://localhost:3001/companies
2. Wait for page to load completely
3. Verify company selector appears in header
4. Select "AI Ventures" from dropdown
5. Click "üåê Visualize Network"
6. **Verify Modal Contents**:
   - AI Ventures as large, central node
   - Dr. Alex Chen (Founder) connected to company
   - Any matched job seekers connected to Dr. Alex Chen
   - No nodes beyond 2 levels
7. Close modal
8. Click "üåê Network" on CloudTech Solutions card
9. **Verify**: Different network focused on CloudTech

### **Procedure B: Data Accuracy Cross-Check**
1. Note hiring authorities shown in company cards
2. Open company network visualization
3. **Verify**: Same authorities appear in visualization
4. Check job seeker matches on `/matches` page
5. **Verify**: Matched job seekers appear in company networks
6. Cross-reference with `/hiring-authorities` page
7. **Verify**: Authority details match across pages

### **Procedure C: Performance & Responsiveness**
1. Open company with many connections
2. **Measure**: Time from click to modal open
3. **Expected**: < 500ms for modal to appear
4. **Verify**: Smooth animations and transitions
5. **Test**: Rapid switching between companies
6. **Verify**: No lag or memory leaks
