## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Environment Configuration
Add your OpenAI API key to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
The OpenAI package should already be installed. If not:

```bash
npm install openai
```

### 4. Usage

#### In the Skills Page
1. Navigate to `/skills`
2. Click the **"ðŸ¤– AI Enhance Salaries"** button
3. Wait for the enhancement process to complete
4. Skills will now show AI-generated salary data with enhanced accuracy

#### API Endpoints

**Single Skill Lookup:**
```
GET /api/salary-data?skillName=React&category=Frontend&experienceLevel=Senior
```

**Batch Processing:**
```
POST /api/salary-data
{
  "skills": [
    { "name": "React", "category": "Frontend" },
    { "name": "Node.js", "category": "Backend" }
  ],
  "options": {
    "location": "San Francisco",
    "experienceLevel": "Mid"
  }
}
```

## Cost Management

### Rate Limiting
- Automatic delays between API calls
- Batch processing to minimize requests
- Intelligent caching (24-hour cache)

### Fallback System
If OpenAI is unavailable or API key is missing:
- Falls back to static salary calculations
- Application continues to function normally
- No user-facing errors

### Expected Costs
- **GPT-4 usage**: ~$0.03 per skill enhancement
- **Typical enhancement**: 20 skills = ~$0.60
- **Caching**: Reduces repeat costs significantly
